 *  A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program âˆ’
 *
 *   auto
 *   register
 *   static
 *   extern

   * The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence
   * during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it
   * comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them
   * to maintain their values between function calls.
   *
   * The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it
   * causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.

 /*
  * The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a
  *  register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the
  *  register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it
  *  (as it does not have a memory location).
